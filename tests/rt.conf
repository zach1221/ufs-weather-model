### RT.CONF FORMATTING ###
# COMPILE Line ( Items separated by a | )
# Item 1: COMPILE - This tells rt.conf the following information is to be used in setting up a compile job
# Item 2: Compile name - The rt.sh will add _gnu or _intel to it. There must be no duplicate names for each compiler.
#                        If two compilations are identical except compiler, please use the same name for each.
# Item 3: Compiler to use in build (intel or gnu)
# Item 4: CMAKE Options - Provide all CMAKE options for the build
# Item 5: Machines to run on (- is used to ignore specified machines, + is used to only run on specified machines)
## -> EX: + hera orion gaea = compile will only run on hera orion and gaea machines
## -> EX: - wcoss2 acorn = compile will NOT be run on wcoss2 or acorn
# Item 6: [set as fv3]. Used to control the compile job only if FV3 was present, previously used to run a test w/o compiling code
#
# RUN Line ( Items separated by a | )
## NOTE: The build resulting from the COMPILE line above the RUN line will be used to run the test
# Item 1: RUN - This tells rt.conf the following information is to be used in setting up a model run
# Item 2: Test name. (Which test in the tests/tests directory should be sourced)
# Item 3: Machines to run on (- is used to ignore specified machines, + is used to only run on specified machines).
## reference example above
# Item 4: Controls whether the run creates its own baseline or it uses the baseline from a different (control) test.
# Item 5: Test name to compare baselines with if not itself.
